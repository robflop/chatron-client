On opening: Dialog (or seperate html file) opens and asks for username and channel (html form field)
-> After submitting, send html post request to chatron-server with username and channel
-> Check if username exists in chatron-server, if it does reject with appropriate error, if not emit an okay event or so
-> also emit member list for the channel(s) being connected to i guess
-> On successful login, electron client loads the main html file
-> Use loops to display each channel and each member in the appropriate lists to the left and right
-> chat bar is a html form field, on submit sends a post request to chatron server with message content and username
-> on submitting a message, chatron-server updates the messages in the channel and emits a message event to chatron-client
-> on receiving the message event, chatron-client updates the chat window with the new content
